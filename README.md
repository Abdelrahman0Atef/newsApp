# News App ðŸ“°
**The Goal**<br/>
The goal of this project was to build a simple news application using Flutter. I focused on fetching news articles related to the US from a REST API, filtering them by categories, and displaying them using WebView.

## What I Built
I built a news app that allows users to view articles in different categories, such as Sports, Technology, Business, and more. The app fetches news from a REST API using Dio and displays content from external websites directly within the app using WebView.

## The Finished App
The app is a minimalist and user-friendly news app with a simple interface that makes navigating through articles easy and intuitive.
